# SSHUTS
This is a compilation of the shell scripts I create. Read more about them below

### ✔️ Quick-C
Quick-C is a tool for people learning C to more quickly compile and run their C programs. <br>
**USAGE**
```
quick_c foo.c <args>
```
For now, it always creates a binary with the same name as the original .c file. Running the command both creates and executes the binary produced by the compiler. If there are any compilation errors, it will show them in full.
